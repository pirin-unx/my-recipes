    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        My version of chicken Parmesan is a little different than what they do in the restaurants, with less sauce and a crispier crust.
    </p>

    <h3>Recommendations before starting</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Pound chicken to an even thickness:</strong> Pound the boneless chicken breasts out to an even width so they cook evenly. 
            Basically, you're pounding the thick part down to the size of the thin part, about a half-inch thick.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Don't skimp on seasoning:</strong>Salt and pepper the chicken well. Then don't bother with salting the flour and bread crumbs.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Add Parmesan to the bread crumbs:</strong>Use Panko bread crumbs mixed with a little finely grated Parmesan cheese. When you fry the breaded chicken, 
            the Parmesan will give it an extra crunch and exciting flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Rest before cooking:</strong>Before frying, let the breaded chicken sit on the counter for about 15 minutes to allow the coating to adhere to the chicken breast.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Go easy on the sauce:</strong>THE KEY: Don't drown the poor breaded and fried chicken in sauce and smother it in cheese. Too much of a good thing is too much. 
            You did all the work creating a crisp coating, why make it soggy with too much sauce and cheese?
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Make sure your oven is hot, hot, hot:</strong>Be sure your oven is completely preheated to 450 F. You'll want the cheese to brown slightly and the breading to crisp up before 
            the chicken gets overcooked, and a nice hot oven is the way to go.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>½ cup prepared tomato sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>½ cup grated provolone cheese</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. 
            Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch.
        </li>
        <li>
            Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Using a sifter or strainer; sprinkle flour over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides
        </li>
        <li>
            Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. 
            Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. 
            The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, 
            fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. 
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
