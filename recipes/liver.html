    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds sliced beef liver</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups milk, or as needed</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, divided</li>
        <li>2 large Vidalia onions, sliced into rings</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Gently rinse liver slices under cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Place in a shallow dish; pour in enough milk to cover.
            Let stand while preparing onions, or set aside for longer if you have time. Soaking will remove any bitterness.
        </li>
        <li>
            Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion rings; cook and stir in butter until 
            tender and soft, about 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer onions into a bowl and set the skillet aside. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Place flour on a plate; season with salt and pepper. Drain milk from liver and coat liver slices in flour mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Melt remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in the same skillet; increase heat to medium-high and fry coated liver slices until lightly browned, about 3 to 4 minutes on each side. 
            Return onions to the skillet and reduce heat to medium; continue to cook until onions are heated through and liver is slightly pink inside, or longer to suit your taste.
